## What is an Operating System?

**Operating System:** Software that converts hardware into a useful from for applications.

Levels: (1) Hardware, (2) Operating System, (3) Applications, (4) Users

The Operating Systems Requests: Memory Management/Allocation, File System Management, Cache Access and Storage. 

**Note: Applications don't talk to the hardware directly, they talk to the operating system.**

### Virtualization

The OS takes a physical resource and transforms it into a virtual form of itself. 

### Resource Manager

The OS manages resources such as CPU, memory, and disk. 

The OS allows many programs to run which shares CPU.

Many programs concurrently access their own instructions and data.

## Three Pieces: First

Virtualizing the CPU

```out
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    if (argc != 2){
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: cpu <string>\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    char *str = argv[1];
    while (1) {
        Spin(1); // checks the time and returns once it has run for a second
        printf("%s\n", str);
    }
    return 0'
}
```

## Virtualizing Memory

The model of physical memory is an array of bytes. 

A program keeps all of its data structures in memory. 

Read Memory (load)

Write Memory (store)
