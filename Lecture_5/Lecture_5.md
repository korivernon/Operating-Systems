## Byte Ordering

How are the bytes within a multi-byte word ordered in memory?

Big Endian
- 01 23 45 67

Little Endian
- 67 45 23 01

## Pointers
- Pointers are addresses
- Pointers hold the address of another fariable

To declare: `int *foo;`

- Two new operators
- `&x` : get the address of x
- `*p` : access the value of the pointed-to-variable (dereferencing)

Boolean and Characters are 1 byte; Integers are 4 bytes...

32 Bit architecture = 4 bytes


## Call by Value vs Call by Reference

**Write a function called swap that given two integers, switches it's values**

## Structs

Structs cannot have methods or functions.
